# Honeypot-ThreatIntel-System
HoneySentinel is a security research project that combines a Raspberry Pi-based honeypot with centralized logging, visualization, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment. It is designed to capture real-world attacks, analyze malicious activity, and provide insights into attacker behavior through an SOC-style monitoring pipeline.
